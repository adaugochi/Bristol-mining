                          <p>The provision of financial advisory and placement services to our clients and prospective clients (“Client Services”);

              Our marketing and business development activities, including events we host, social media properties we create, and emails that we send (“Marketing Activities”).
              We collect and process personal data about a number of different individuals through the provision of the Services.

                          <p> We operate in a regulated industry. This means we are required to obtain certain information before we can accept someone as a client. For individual clients, this includes, but is not limited to:</p>
